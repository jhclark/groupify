groupify
========

A tiny utility for partitioning a single group into smaller groups.

Usage
-----

First, create a text file called `who.txt` right next to groupify.py and
place the names of the members who will attend the next meeting in this file,
one per line.

Next, run groupify to return a random group assignment:
```
./groupify.py <max_per_group>
```
